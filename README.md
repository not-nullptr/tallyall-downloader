# tallyall Downloader

Does what you expect.

# Ethics

Tally Hall has been (mostly) inactive since 2011. All members now have different sources of income and [tallyall](https://tallyall.club) is a publicly available archive; this project just downloads it.

# Usage

1. Run `npm i`
2. Run `npm run dev`

This will download the `Tally Hall` folder into the `go` folder. This contains the vast majority of Tally Hall content: .flacs and .mp3s of all albums.
